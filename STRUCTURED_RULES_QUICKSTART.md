## Overview

The ProjectPrompt Structured Rules System provides enterprise-grade rule management with AI-powered suggestions, sophisticated modeling, and professional documentation export.

## Quick Commands

### Generate Structured Rules
```bash
# Basic generation (recommended)
project-prompt rules generate-structured-rules

# AI-enhanced with confidence filtering
project-prompt rules generate-structured-rules --ai --confidence 0.8

# Specify project type for better targeting
project-prompt rules generate-structured-rules --type web_application

# Custom output file
project-prompt rules generate-structured-rules --output my_project_rules.yaml
```

### Validate Rules
```bash
# Validate a structured rules file
project-prompt rules validate-structured-rules rules.yaml

# Detailed validation output
project-prompt rules validate-structured-rules rules.yaml --verbose
```

## What You Get

### Rule Structure
- **RuleSet**: Complete rule collection with metadata
- **RuleGroup**: Organized categories (Technology, Architecture, Security, etc.)
- **RuleItem**: Individual rules with priority and context
- **RuleContext**: File-specific targeting (extensions, directories, patterns)

### Priority Levels
- **ðŸ”´ MANDATORY**: Critical rules that must be followed
- **ðŸŸ¡ RECOMMENDED**: Best practices that should be implemented  
- **ðŸŸ¢ OPTIONAL**: Nice-to-have improvements

### Categories
- **TECHNOLOGY**: Framework and language constraints
- **ARCHITECTURE**: Structural and design patterns
- **CODE_STYLE**: Formatting and style requirements
- **TESTING**: Test coverage and quality standards
- **SECURITY**: Security best practices
- **DOCUMENTATION**: Documentation requirements
- **PERFORMANCE**: Performance optimization rules

## Example Output

```yaml
name: my_project_rules
version: 1.0.0
description: AI-generated rules for My Project
metadata:
  generated_at: 2025-06-01T00:00:00
  project_type: cli_tool
  ai_enhanced: true

groups:
  - name: technology_constraints
    description: Technology stack requirements
    category: technology
    rules:
      - content: "Use Python 3.8+ for all development"
        priority: mandatory
        category: technology
        context:
          file_extensions: ['.py']
          directories: ['src/', 'tests/']
        tags: ['python', 'version']
        examples:
          - "requires-python = \">=3.8\""
```

## Advanced Usage

### Project Types
