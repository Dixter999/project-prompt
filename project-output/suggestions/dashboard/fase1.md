# Dashboard Enhancement Implementation Plan

## Current State Analysis

### Issues with Current Premium Dashboard:
1. **Empty dependency graph** - Shows 0 connections despite having dependencies
2. **Generic functional groups** - Groups like "Frontend" with 98 files are too broad
3. **No file-specific functionality descriptions**
4. **Missing actionable insights using AI**
5. **Free dashboard is too basic** - Lacks essential information

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Enhance Free Dashboard

#### 1.1 Add Functional Groups to Free Dashboard

**Branch:** `feature/enhanced-free-dashboard`  
**Description:** Migrate essential premium features to free dashboard

**Files to modify:**
- `src/ui/dashboard_view.py` - Add functional groups display
- `src/analyzers/functionality_analyzer.py` - Extract basic group detection
- `src/generators/markdown_dashboard.py` - Update free dashboard template

**Functionalities:**
- Display functional groups with file counts
- Show basic project structure
- Include dependency metrics summary
- Add branch information

**Implementation Prompt:**
```
I am developing ProjectPrompt, an intelligent project assistant that analyzes codebases.

I am in **Phase 1**, task **1.1 Add Functional Groups to Free Dashboard** and need to enhance the free dashboard to include functional groups currently only in premium.

Please help me to:
1. Create branch feature/enhanced-free-dashboard
2. Modify the free dashboard to include functional groups section from premium
3. Ensure the free version shows groups but without detailed file listings
4. Keep the premium differentiation by not including AI-powered insights

The current free dashboard only shows basic metrics. I need to add the functional groups section showing group names, file counts, and completion percentages.
```

### Phase 2: AI-Powered Group Analysis

#### 2.1 Implement Group Analysis with Anthropic API

**Branch:** `feature/ai-group-analysis`  
**Description:** Add AI-powered analysis for each functional group

**Files to create:**
- `src/analyzers/ai_group_analyzer.py` - AI-powered group analysis
- `src/templates/group_analysis_template.md` - Template for group reports
- `src/commands/analyze_group.py` - New CLI command

**Functionalities:**
- Analyze each file in a group to determine its specific functionality
- Generate detailed group analysis reports

I am in **Phase 2**, task **2.1 Implement Group Analysis with Anthropic API** and need to create AI-powered analysis for functional groups.

Please help me to:
1. Create branch feature/ai-group-analysis
2. Implement an AI analyzer that uses Anthropic API to analyze each file in a group
3. Generate markdown reports with tables showing:
   - File name and path
   - Specific functionality description
   - Dependencies (imports/exports)
   - Code quality metrics
4. Save reports to project-output/analyses/groups/[group_name].md

The analyzer should process files in batches to optimize API usage and provide progress updates.
```

#### 2.2 Enhanced Dependency Analysis

**Branch:** `feature/enhanced-dependency-graph`  
**Description:** Fix and enhance dependency graph visualization

**Files to modify:**
- `src/analyzers/dependency_graph.py` - Fix connection detection

- Detect circular dependencies
- Generate dependency matrix tables

**Implementation Prompt:**
```
I am developing ProjectPrompt, an intelligent project assistant.

I am in **Phase 2**, task **2.2 Enhanced Dependency Analysis** and need to fix the dependency graph showing 0 connections.

Please help me to:
1. Create branch feature/enhanced-dependency-graph
2. Debug why current analysis shows 0 connections despite detecting 857 dependencies
3. Implement proper connection tracking between files
4. Create text-based visualization of dependencies
5. Add dependency matrix table to dashboard

The current implementation detects dependencies but fails to show connections. Focus on fixing this core issue.
```

### Phase 3: Premium Dashboard Enhancements

#### 3.1 AI-Generated Insights and Suggestions

**Branch:** `feature/ai-dashboard-insights`  
**Description:** Add AI-powered insights to premium dashboard

**Files to create:**
- `src/integrations/anthropic_insights.py` - Generate AI insights
- `src/templates/insights_template.md` - Template for insights section
- `src/generators/suggestion_generator.py` - Generate actionable suggestions

**Functionalities:**
- Architecture quality assessment
- Performance bottleneck detection
- Security vulnerability hints
- Refactoring suggestions by group
- Development priority recommendations

**Implementation Prompt:**
```
I am developing ProjectPrompt, an intelligent project assistant.

I am in **Phase 3**, task **3.1 AI-Generated Insights and Suggestions** and need to add AI-powered insights to the premium dashboard.

Please help me to:
1. Create branch feature/ai-dashboard-insights
2. Implement AI insight generation using Anthropic API that analyzes:
   - Overall project architecture
   - Code quality patterns
   - Potential improvements per functional group
3. Add new sections to premium dashboard:
   - "ü§ñ AI-Powered Insights"
   - "üìã Actionable Recommendations"
   - "üéØ Development Priorities"
4. Generate specific, actionable suggestions not generic advice

The insights should be based on the actual code analysis, not template responses.
```

#### 3.2 Interactive Group Analysis Commands

**Branch:** `feature/interactive-group-analysis`  
**Description:** Add interactive commands for detailed group analysis

**Files to create:**
- `src/commands/group_commands.py` - New group analysis commands
- `src/ui/group_analysis_view.py` - Interactive group analysis UI
- `src/utils/cost_estimator.py` - API cost estimation

2. Add new CLI command: pp analyze-group [group_name] --api anthropic
3. Implement cost estimation showing estimated API usage before analysis
4. Create interactive menu for selecting specific files within a group
5. Add progress bar during analysis
6. Save results to project-output/analyses/groups/

The command should warn users about API costs and allow them to cancel before processing.
```

### Phase 4: Dashboard Differentiation

#### 4.1 Clear Feature Separation

**Branch:** `feature/dashboard-tiers`  
**Description:** Clearly differentiate free vs premium dashboards

**Free Dashboard Features:**
