## 3. Deployment Plan

### Pre-Deployment
1. Run complete test suite
   ```
   python run_complete_test.sh
   ```

2. Verify freemium system
   ```
   python test_freemium_system.py
   ```

3. Validate integration with Anthropic API
   ```
   python test_anthropic_integration.py
   ```

4. Review final documentation
   ```
   python -m pydocmd build
   ```

### Package Generation
1. Update version number in `setup.py` and `__init__.py`

2. Generate distribution packages
   ```
   python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
   ```

3. Verify structure of generated packages
   ```
   tar -tvf dist/*.tar.gz
   ```

4. Run installation test in isolated environment
   ```
   python -m venv test_env
   source test_env/bin/activate
   pip install dist/project_prompt-*.whl
   python -c "import project_prompt; print(project_prompt.__version__)"
   ```

### Publication
1. Upload packages to PyPI
   ```
   python -m twine upload dist/*
   ```

2. Create release on GitHub
   ```
   gh release create v1.0.0 --title "ProjectPrompt v1.0.0" --notes-file release-notes.md
   ```

3. Publish updated documentation
   ```
   python deploy_docs.py --production
   ```

4. Announce release on official channels
   ```
   python scripts/announce_release.py --version 1.0.0
   ```

## 4. Post-Deployment Verification

### Installation
- [ ] Verify installation from PyPI
- [ ] Check installation from GitHub
- [ ] Validate execution of main commands
- [ ] Confirm correct creation of configuration files

### Functionality
