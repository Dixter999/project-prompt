# Pending Task: Fix Implementation Issues for Contextual Prompt Generator

After implementing Task 3.3 "Generaci√≥n de prompts contextuales mejorados", we have identified some implementation issues that need to be fixed.

## Issues Identified

1. Method missing in ProjectScanner:
   - `ProjectScanner` object has no attribute `get_timestamp()`
   - This causes the `generate_prompts` command to fail when saving prompts

2. CLI integration issues:
   - Enhanced prompt generator needs better integration with the existing prompt generator

## Tasks to Complete

1. Fix the ProjectScanner class:
   - Add the missing `get_timestamp()` method
   - Or refactor the code to use a different approach for timestamping

2. Fix the ContextualPromptGenerator implementation:
   - Ensure it properly extends the base PromptGenerator
   - Make sure all required methods are implemented correctly

3. Improve error handling:
   - Add appropriate exception handling for the missing methods
   - Provide better error messages to users

## Proposed Timeline

- Priority: High (blocking functionality)
- Estimated time: 1 day
- Suggested branch: `fix/contextual-prompt-generator-implementation`
