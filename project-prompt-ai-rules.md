### Naming Conventions
















## Code Style Requirements

### Language Specific Rules
















### Error Handling
















## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage and Quality


- **Unit test coverage requirement**: All public functions must have corresponding unit tests











- **Pytest best practices**: Use pytest fixtures for test data setup





### Testing Frameworks


## Security Requirements





### Configuration security requirement
Validate and sanitize all configuration inputs


**Reasoning:** Configuration files detected, ensure input validation















## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation








- **Code documentation requirement**: All public functions and classes must have docstrings









### Project Documentation
- README files required for major modules
- API documentation for all public interfaces
- Inline comments for complex business logic

## Performance Guidelines

















## AI Analysis Preferences

### Focus Areas
Based on the detected patterns in your project:

1. Testing framework in use: pytest, unit_testing, jest, unittest

1. Documentation practices: readme_present, docstrings_present, api_documentation

1. Security measures: encryption_usage, configuration_files


### Detected Technologies


### Suggestion Priorities
1. **High Priority (Mandatory)**: Rules that prevent bugs or security issues
2. **Medium Priority (Recommended)**: Best practices for maintainability  
3. **Low Priority (Optional)**: Nice-to-have improvements


### Detected Inconsistencies

- ⚠️ **Naming Convention**: Mixed naming conventions in Python files
  - **Suggested Fix**: Establish consistent naming standards



## Custom Analysis Rules

### When analyzing this project:














1. Coding standards enforcement (High confidence: 0.9)



### When suggesting improvements:






1. 4-space indentation detected as the current pattern



1. Docstrings detected in project, maintain consistency



1. Inconsistent naming conventions detected, standardization needed



1. Pytest framework detected, fixtures improve test maintainability





## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Critical Rules (Week 1-2)














- [ ] **Coding standards enforcement**
  - Implementation: Establish and enforce consistent coding standards
  - Confidence: 0.9/1.0



### Phase 2: Quality Improvements (Week 3-4)  






- [ ] **Consistent indentation style**
  - Implementation: Use 4 spaces for indentation, never tabs
  - Confidence: 0.8/1.0



- [ ] **Code documentation requirement**
  - Implementation: All public functions and classes must have docstrings
  - Confidence: 0.8/1.0









### Phase 3: Optional Enhancements (Month 2)










- [ ] **Consistent naming convention**
  - Implementation: Use snake_case for Python file names and variables
  - Confidence: 0.7/1.0



- [ ] **Pytest best practices**
  - Implementation: Use pytest fixtures for test data setup
  - Confidence: 0.7/1.0





## Quality Metrics

### Current Project Health  
- **Code Consistency**: 6/10
- **Documentation Coverage**: 7/10  
- **Testing Maturity**: 8/10
- **Security Awareness**: 7/10

### Expected Improvement with Rules
- **Code Consistency**: 8/10 (+2)
- **Documentation Coverage**: 10/10 (+3)
- **Testing Maturity**: 10/10 (+4)
- **Security Awareness**: 9/10 (+2)
