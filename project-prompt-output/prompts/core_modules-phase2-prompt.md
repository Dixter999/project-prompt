# Implementation Prompt: Core Modules - Phase 2

## Project Context

I am working on implementing improvements for my project based on AI-generated suggestions. I have completed the analysis phase and now need to implement **Phase 2: Code Documentation and Type Hints** from my improvement plan.

## Phase Details

**Branch to create**: `feature/core-documentation-types`
**Phase Description**: Enhance code documentation and add type hints for better maintainability and IDE support âœ…

## Files to Modify/Create

- **`src/core/*.py`** - Add type hints to all core modules
- **`docs/api/core/`** - Generate API documentation
- **`docs/examples/core/`** - Add usage examples

## Libraries/Tools Required

- **`sphinx`** - Documentation generation
- **`mypy`** - Static type checking
- **`sphinx-autodoc-typehints`** - Type hints in documentation

## Implementation Steps

1. Add type hints to all function parameters and return values
2. Add docstrings following Google style
3. Set up Sphinx documentation structure
4. Create example code snippets
5. Configure mypy for type checking

## Specific Requirements

Based on the analysis of my project structure, please help me implement this phase by:

1. **Creating the branch**: Guide me through creating `feature/core-documentation-types` and setting up the development environment for this phase.

2. **File Implementation**: For each file listed above, provide specific implementation details including:
   - Complete code structure and architecture
   - Integration with existing codebase
   - Error handling and edge cases
   - Documentation and docstrings

3. **Dependencies Management**: Help me properly integrate the required libraries:
   - Installation commands
   - Configuration setup
   - Integration patterns
   - Version compatibility

4. **Testing Strategy**: Provide guidance on:
   - Unit tests for new functionality
   - Integration tests
   - Test data setup
   - Validation criteria

5. **Validation Steps**: Define how to verify this phase is correctly implemented:
   - Functional testing procedures
   - Performance validation
   - Integration verification
   - Code quality checks

## Context Files

The following files are particularly relevant to this implementation:
See project structure in: `project-prompt-output/analysis/project-structure.md`

## Expected Outcome

By the end of this phase, I should have:
- Branch `feature/core-documentation-types` with all changes committed
- All specified files created/modified with proper functionality
- Dependencies installed and properly configured
- Tests passing and covering new functionality
- Documentation updated to reflect changes

Please provide detailed, step-by-step guidance to implement this phase successfully, including specific code examples and best practices for my project structure.
