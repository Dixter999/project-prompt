# Implementation Prompt: Feature Modules - Phase 2

## Project Context

I am working on implementing improvements for my project based on AI-generated suggestions. I have completed the analysis phase and now need to implement **Phase 2: Documentation Enhancement** from my improvement plan.

## Phase Details

**Branch to create**: `feature/comprehensive-docs`
**Phase Description**: Implement comprehensive documentation using Sphinx with API references and usage examples âœ…

## Files to Modify/Create

- **`docs/conf.py`** - Sphinx configuration
- **`docs/index.rst`** - Main documentation page
- **`docs/api/`** - API documentation directory
- **`docs/examples/`** - Usage examples directory
- **`src/**/*.py`** - Add docstrings to all modules

## Libraries/Tools Required

- **`sphinx`** - Documentation generator
- **`sphinx-autodoc`** - API documentation generator
- **`sphinx-rtd-theme`** - Documentation theme

## Implementation Steps

1. Initialize Sphinx documentation structure
2. Configure Sphinx for automatic API documentation
3. Add comprehensive docstrings to all modules
4. Create usage examples and tutorials
5. Set up documentation hosting (e.g., ReadTheDocs)
6. Add documentation build to CI/CD pipeline

## Specific Requirements

Based on the analysis of my project structure, please help me implement this phase by:

1. **Creating the branch**: Guide me through creating `feature/comprehensive-docs` and setting up the development environment for this phase.

2. **File Implementation**: For each file listed above, provide specific implementation details including:
   - Complete code structure and architecture
   - Integration with existing codebase
   - Error handling and edge cases
   - Documentation and docstrings

3. **Dependencies Management**: Help me properly integrate the required libraries:
   - Installation commands
   - Configuration setup
   - Integration patterns
   - Version compatibility

4. **Testing Strategy**: Provide guidance on:
   - Unit tests for new functionality
   - Integration tests
   - Test data setup
   - Validation criteria

5. **Validation Steps**: Define how to verify this phase is correctly implemented:
   - Functional testing procedures
   - Performance validation
   - Integration verification
   - Code quality checks

## Context Files

The following files are particularly relevant to this implementation:
See project structure in: `project-prompt-output/analysis/project-structure.md`

## Expected Outcome

By the end of this phase, I should have:
- Branch `feature/comprehensive-docs` with all changes committed
- All specified files created/modified with proper functionality
- Dependencies installed and properly configured
- Tests passing and covering new functionality
- Documentation updated to reflect changes

Please provide detailed, step-by-step guidance to implement this phase successfully, including specific code examples and best practices for my project structure.
