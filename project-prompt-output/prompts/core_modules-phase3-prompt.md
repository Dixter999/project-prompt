# Implementation Prompt: Core Modules - Phase 3

## Project Context

I am working on implementing improvements for my project based on AI-generated suggestions. I have completed the analysis phase and now need to implement **Phase 3: Performance Optimization** from my improvement plan.

## Phase Details

**Branch to create**: `feature/core-performance`
**Phase Description**: Optimize core modules for better performance and resource utilization âœ…

## Files to Modify/Create

- **`src/core/analyzer.py`** - Implement caching and parallel processing
- **`src/core/scanner.py`** - Optimize file scanning algorithms
- **`src/core/cache_manager.py`** - New cache management system

## Libraries/Tools Required

- **`concurrent.futures`** - Parallel processing
- **`functools.lru_cache`** - Function result caching
- **`cProfile`** - Performance profiling

## Implementation Steps

1. Profile current performance bottlenecks
2. Implement caching for expensive operations
3. Add parallel processing for independent tasks
4. Create cache invalidation strategy
5. Benchmark and document improvements

## Specific Requirements

Based on the analysis of my project structure, please help me implement this phase by:

1. **Creating the branch**: Guide me through creating `feature/core-performance` and setting up the development environment for this phase.

2. **File Implementation**: For each file listed above, provide specific implementation details including:
   - Complete code structure and architecture
   - Integration with existing codebase
   - Error handling and edge cases
   - Documentation and docstrings

3. **Dependencies Management**: Help me properly integrate the required libraries:
   - Installation commands
   - Configuration setup
   - Integration patterns
   - Version compatibility

4. **Testing Strategy**: Provide guidance on:
   - Unit tests for new functionality
   - Integration tests
   - Test data setup
   - Validation criteria

5. **Validation Steps**: Define how to verify this phase is correctly implemented:
   - Functional testing procedures
   - Performance validation
   - Integration verification
   - Code quality checks

## Context Files

The following files are particularly relevant to this implementation:
See project structure in: `project-prompt-output/analysis/project-structure.md`

## Expected Outcome

By the end of this phase, I should have:
- Branch `feature/core-performance` with all changes committed
- All specified files created/modified with proper functionality
- Dependencies installed and properly configured
- Tests passing and covering new functionality
- Documentation updated to reflect changes

Please provide detailed, step-by-step guidance to implement this phase successfully, including specific code examples and best practices for my project structure.
