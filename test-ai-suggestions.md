## Detected Patterns

### Technology Stack


### Architectural Patterns


### Current Practices

- Testing framework in use: unittest, unit_testing, jest, pytest

- Documentation practices: api_documentation, readme_present, docstrings_present

- Security measures: encryption_usage, configuration_files



### Inconsistencies Found

- ⚠️ **Naming Convention**: Mixed naming conventions in Python files
  - **Impact**: Medium - affects code readability
  - **Suggested Fix**: Establish consistent naming standards



## Suggested Rules

### High Priority (Mandatory)


#### Unit test coverage requirement

**Rule:** All public functions must have corresponding unit tests

**Category:** Testing  
**Confidence:** 0.8/1.0

**Reasoning:** Testing infrastructure detected, ensure comprehensive coverage





---



#### Configuration security requirement

**Rule:** Validate and sanitize all configuration inputs

**Category:** Security  
**Confidence:** 0.8/1.0

**Reasoning:** Configuration files detected, ensure input validation





---











### Medium Priority (Recommended)






#### Consistent indentation style

**Rule:** Use 4 spaces for indentation, never tabs

**Category:** Code_style  
**Confidence:** 0.8/1.0

**Reasoning:** 4-space indentation detected as the current pattern



---



#### Code documentation requirement

**Rule:** All public functions and classes must have docstrings

**Category:** Documentation  
**Confidence:** 0.8/1.0

**Reasoning:** Docstrings detected in project, maintain consistency



---



#### Consistent naming convention

**Rule:** Use snake_case for Python file names and variables

**Category:** Code_style  
**Confidence:** 0.7/1.0

**Reasoning:** Inconsistent naming conventions detected, standardization needed



---



#### Pytest best practices

**Rule:** Use pytest fixtures for test data setup

**Category:** Testing  
**Confidence:** 0.7/1.0

**Reasoning:** Pytest framework detected, fixtures improve test maintainability

## AI Analysis Details

### Analysis Method
- **Pattern Recognition**: Automated scanning of codebase structure and content
- **Best Practices Database**: Comparison against industry standards for detected technologies
- **Inconsistency Detection**: Identification of contradictory patterns within the codebase
- **Confidence Scoring**: Statistical analysis of pattern strength and clarity

### Limitations
- AI analysis is based on static code analysis and may miss runtime behaviors
- Suggestions are general best practices and may need project-specific adjustments
- Human review and validation is recommended for all suggestions
- Domain-specific requirements may not be fully captured

### Feedback Loop
